# Project Summary

## Project Topic

### Fanlinc

## Project Objectives

There are a lot of applications out there that allow users to post interesting stuff or organize events for them. However, none of such applications can provide a variety of categories, enable users to arrange events, and allow vendors to sell derivative products of a certain culture at the same time.

The objective of Fanlinc is to provide a platform for fans who share the same interest to forge meaningful connections between one another, purchase product (i.e.: animation derivative, gaming figure) as well as assist them to hold events so that they can branch out their fandom, and enhance their relationship regardless of distance.

## Key Users
