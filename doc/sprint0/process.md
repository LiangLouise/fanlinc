# Process

## Team organization

Cheng Gao and Jiasong Liang have taken CSCC10 before, therefore, they have a intermediate knowledge on User Interface and User Experience. As a result, we assigned Summary.md to Cheng Gao and User Experience to Jiasong Liang, and the tool we used is StoryboadThat. Before we start working on the product backlog, we elobrate the problems and bugs that we might encouter when user interact with our application, and came to an agreement on the definition of Done.md, which means what the final project should be like when we finish it. For PB.md, we came up with 6 sections in total, each is written by one of our group member that is most familar with that field based on their previous experience and knowledge. Finally, we had a small chat to figure out which applications are considered as our competitors based on the functionality.

## Decision making

At the beginning, we have anonymous voting on choosing which project to work on and the one with the highest vote takes the priority. While implementing the document, whenever a team member come up a new idea, they would share their idea with the rest of group to refine the details and to see if it is logic, doable and suitable for our application. All the decisions are made after full discussion.

## Prioritizing User Stories

The priority of the stories is as defined in the backlog and it is as follows:

1. User
2. Fandom
3. Contacts
4. Search (Integrated)
5. Events
6. Maps

Reasons for such priority ranking:

1. User has the highest priority, because users are the most fundamental building blocks of the database. Almost all the operations are involving around users.
2. Fandom is a group of fans on a particular theme. It is essentially a group of users, so a lot of operations are involved with it naturally.
3. contacts forms a network between fans. A lot of basic operations such as chatting and adding relationships between users.
4. Search, Events and Maps are increasingly more difficult, and we need to spend more time researching about how to implement these operations. In the worst scenario, we can choose to not at these features, because they are not the core features of this product.



## Meetings and Communications

We had team meetings every Tuesday after the tutorials and Friday afternoon at Humanity Wing of the campus. Each meeting lasted for about 1 hours. At the first meeting we decided which topic we would work on, the major features we need to implement and how to divide the work, such as writing the user stories, searching the competitions and creating the personas. 

And during the following meetings, each member reported their progress over their own work and decide what to focus on before the next meeting. 

Apart from meeting in person regularly, if any members have questions and need help, they can reach other team members through the channel we set up on slack or grouping chat on discord. 


## Next phase

For the next sprint, we need to get used to using Jira to report and track the issues during the development and progress of the work. We want to get the first two prioritized features done, namely user and fandom done. Having these two features done will form a fundamental framework of the project. We then would have time to research more about how to implement more advanced features such as search.
