# Process

## Team organization

## Decision making

Each team member share their idea, and we find the optical All the decisions are made after full discussion. This means that we have anonymous voting on choosing which topic to work on and the one with the highest vote takes the priority.

## Prioritizing User Stories

The priority of the stories is as defined in the backlog and it is as follows:

1. User
2. Fandom
3. Contacts
4. Search (Integrated)
5. Events
6. Maps



## Meetings and Communications

We had team meetings every Tuesday after the tutorials and Friday afternoon at Humanity Wing of the campus. Each meeting lasted for about 1 hours. At the first meeting we decided which topic we would work on, the major features we need to implement and how to divide the work, such as writing the user stories, searching the competitions and creating the personas. 

And during the following meetings, each member reported their progress over their own work and decide what to focus on before the next meeting. 

Apart from meeting in person regularly, if any members have questions and need help, they can reach other team members through the channel we set up on slack or grouping chat on discord. 


## Next phase

For the next sprint, we need to get used to using Jira to report and track the issues during the development and progress of the work.
